                My name is Simon Chidley, class of '25. I'm a computer science major and IDEAS minor
                here at Wesleyan University.

                My concentration in the major was on Computers, but along the way I encountered 
                other disciplines like electrical engineering and 3D design. Click one of the links
                below to showcase the projects I completed (or attempted to complete).
